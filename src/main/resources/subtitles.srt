00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:04,190
Mary? 

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,046
Hi. 

3
00:00:06,148 --> 00:00:06,654
Hello. 

4
00:00:06,772 --> 00:00:09,162
I'm Susan Thompson, resource manager. 

5
00:00:09,306 --> 00:00:13,018
Hi, I'm Mary Hansen and I'm applying for one of your kitchen jobs. 

6
00:00:13,114 --> 00:00:13,566
Great. 

7
00:00:13,668 --> 00:00:15,626
Here's a copy of my resume. 

8
00:00:15,818 --> 00:00:16,222
Great. 

9
00:00:16,276 --> 00:00:17,162
Have a seat, Mary. 

10
00:00:17,226 --> 00:00:18,000
Thank you. 

11
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,034
Mary, do you have any experience working in the kitchen? 

12
00:00:26,162 --> 00:00:28,038
No, but I want to learn. 

13
00:00:28,124 --> 00:00:30,760
I work hard and I cook a lot at home. 

14
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,480
Okay, well, tell me about yourself. 

15
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,560
Well, I love to learn new things. 

16
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:43,340
I'm very organized and I follow directions exactly. 

17
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:48,886
That's why my boss at my last job made me a trainer. 

18
00:00:49,078 --> 00:00:54,462
And the company actually gave me a special certificate for coming to work on time every 

19
00:00:54,516 --> 00:00:55,760
day for a year. 

20
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:02,074
And I'm taking an english class to improve my writing skills. 

21
00:01:02,202 --> 00:01:03,280
That's great. 

22
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,522
Why did you leave your last job? 

23
00:01:05,656 --> 00:01:08,914
It was graveyard and I need to work days. 

24
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:10,066
Oh, I see. 

25
00:01:10,168 --> 00:01:12,946
Well, what hours can you work from 08:00 a.m. 

26
00:01:12,968 --> 00:01:14,354
Until 05:00 p.m.. 

27
00:01:14,552 --> 00:01:14,962
Okay. 

28
00:01:15,016 --> 00:01:17,298
Well, do you have any questions for me, Mary? 

29
00:01:17,474 --> 00:01:18,150
Yes. 

30
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,680
What kind of training is needed? 

31
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,294
Not a lot. 

32
00:01:22,412 --> 00:01:25,238
Most new workers can learn everything the first day. 

33
00:01:25,404 --> 00:01:26,920
Do you have any other questions? 

34
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,174
No, I don't think so. 

35
00:01:29,292 --> 00:01:32,774
But I've heard a lot of good things about your company and I would really like to work 

36
00:01:32,812 --> 00:01:33,302
here. 

37
00:01:33,436 --> 00:01:37,638
Well, I have a few more interviews to do today but I will call you tomorrow if you get 

38
00:01:37,644 --> 00:01:38,198
the job. 

39
00:01:38,284 --> 00:01:38,630
Okay. 

40
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,886
It was sure nice to meet you. 

41
00:01:39,948 --> 00:01:40,814
Nice meeting you too. 

42
00:01:40,852 --> 00:01:42,110
Thank you so much for your time. 

43
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:42,954
Yes, good luck. 

44
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:43,840
Thank you. 

45
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:44,970
Bye.
